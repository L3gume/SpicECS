# SpicECS

Entity-Component-System pattern implementation with built in serialization.

This project is inspired from other existing implementations and served as a learning tool. The code is being used in HabaneroEngine, a side project of mine.

### Missing Features

* JSON serialization [done]
* UUIDs for entities
* Prefabs (Ã  la Unity)
